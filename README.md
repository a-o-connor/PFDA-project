## About this project
This repository contains a Python script and a Jupyter notebook with analysis of a Raman sectroscopy data set. The analysis was completed for the purposes of the *Programming for Data Analytics* module I am taking as part of a Higher Diploma in Computer Science and Data Analytics at ATU. The aim of this project is to demonstrate competency using Python to perform data analysis on large data sets.  
## The Data
The contents of this repository demonstrate the application of [chemometric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics) through Python to analyse Raman spectroscopy data collected during a Tangential Flow Filtration (TFF) process. 
### What is Raman Spectroscopy?
Raman Spectroscopy is an analytical technique widely used in chemistry, biology, and materials science to identify and quantify different compounds in a sample. By using laser light to detect molecular vibrations, Raman spectroscopy generates spectral data that can be analyzed using chemometric techniques to reveal concentrations and molecular information.
### What is TFF? 
TFF stands for Tangential Flow Filtration, a filtration process used to separate and purify biomolecules such as proteins. Unlike traditional filtration where the fluid passes directly through the membrane and the filtrate is collected in a batch, TFF allows the fluid to flow tangentially across the membrane, enabling continuous filtration. TFF is commonly used in biopharmaceutical production to concentrate or purify solutions

In this project, a TFF setup incorporates an online Raman flow cell to monitor the retentate concentration in real time as a solution of immunoglobin 1  passes through the filtration membrane. The initial solution starts with an immunoglobulin concentration of 1 mg/mL, and TFF is used to concentrate the solution up to 10 mg/mL. The online Raman cell monitors the concentration of the retentate in real time to track:

1. Protein concentration during ultrafiltration.
2. End-point detection of diafiltration.
